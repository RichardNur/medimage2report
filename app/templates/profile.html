        <h2>About medimage2report</h2>
        <p>This platform empowers radiologists and medical personnel to automatically generate RSNA-structured reports from medical images or vendor-specific analysis files.
        By uploading a PDF from tools such as brain volumetry software or proprietary MRI analysis, our backend extracts relevant data, constructs a domain-specific prompt,
        and queries a GPT-based engine for report generation. The result is a fast, consistent, and structured report that meets international radiological standards.</p>
        <p>medimage2report is designed with privacy, reproducibility, and diagnostic utility in mind. It's built for clinical support, research workflows, and radiological education.</p>
